# TFG-PitchCorrection
 This repository contains all the materials generated for my end of studies project.

We provide the code for the Python prototype as a class called PitchCorrection and a jupyter notebook already prepared to see how the algorithm works and hear some examples. Some audio recordings are provided to use them with the notebook. It may be necessary to install some of the dependancies for the notebook to work.

We also provide the code for both the audio plugin and the audio application. The code can be seen inside the source folder in both cases.
